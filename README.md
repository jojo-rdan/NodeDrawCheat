# Project - Draw Something Cheat Test

## About the project:

  I did this project as a technical test for a private company. I built a server on the backend and a basic connection to the front to show its functionality.
    
  - Back-end:
      - Node.js
      - Express
        
  - Front-end:
      - React
        
  - Functionality:
      - The user is able to enter the letters given by the game Draw Something, and also the length of the word. And the program will return all possible combinations of existing Spanish words with those letters and that word length.

 ## How to start the project:
 
   - Clone the repo and open it with your code editor.
   - Open a terminal over the client folder and the api folder.
   - Make nodemon index.js over the api folder to run the server.
   - Make npm start over the client folder to run the front.
